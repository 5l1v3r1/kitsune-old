TODO:
- Have someone test this transformation
- Double type is currently hard coded for the data structure and the buffers, fix this
- The current transformation works for a very specific source code structure: 
  - ! There must be a compute method (which may or may not need to be named compute) => *check this*
  - The loop of interest inside the compute method must be annotated with the custom pragma
  - ! It may or may not be true that there must be global variables names buffer_size and list_size => *check this*
  - The compute method must be called within the main method
  - Pretty sure there must be only one operation on the gather variable => *check this*

Notes:
- Buffers are allocated on the stack, and could possibly cause a stack overflow. 

Building on this work:
