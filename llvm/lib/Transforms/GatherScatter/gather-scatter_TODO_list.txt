TODO:
- Have someone test this transformation
- Double type is currently hard coded for the data structure and the buffers, fix this
- Remove the requirement that be global variables named buffer_size and list_size
- Remove the requirement that only one operation can be performed on that gather variable

Notes:
- Buffers are allocated on the stack, and could possibly cause a stack overflow. 
- The current transformation works for a very specific source code structure: 
  - There must be a compute method, which needn't be named "compute," that has the indirect accesses
  - The loop of interest inside the compute method must be annotated with the custom pragma
  - There must be global variables names buffer_size and list_size 
  - The compute method must be called within the main method
  - There must be only one operation on the gather variable

Building on this work:
- This might make a good use case for a custom backend that syncs on memory instead of tokens
